General
* Improve readme file.
* Improve api documentation and check against go doc.
* Add doc.go for each package.

Skeleton
* Make a nicer example.

Commands
* Consider switching to cobra.
    New
        * Need to figure out why filesystem stat gets file not exists on mac https://github.com/spf13/afero/issues/115
        * Consider switching to https://github.com/blang/vfs
        * Need a way to handle multiple go paths
        * Check command usage documentation

Tests
* Add messages to boolean checks etc.

Providers
* Config
    * Test environment set

Router
* Decide on how named routes should be handled when another route is added with the same name, this also includes
refreshing of named route list. Should it panic, overwrite(update) route, return an error string? Should it still be added
to all routes/trie?
* Possible abstract trie to separate interfaces, RouteAdder - RouteSearcher - RouteAdderSearcher?
* Add has method for collection to check if route exists, will also need a compare method on route so that slices in
routes can be checked for equality. See https://play.golang.org/p/J48Jz51C73 and https://play.golang.org/p/mzvvoksjDq
* Decide what to do about nil route handlers.
* Add static file routing.
* Add method not allowed when routes are found but methods don't match (http.Error(rw, "Method Not Allowed", 405)).
    	// TODO: add css, js, img etc
    	if url == "/favicon.ico" || url == "/robots.txt" {
    		//file := config.PublicPath + url
    		//http.ServeFile(response, request, file)
    		return
    	}
* Add controllers.
* Array unique Match request methods.
* Could TestStatusOKIsReturnedByDefault be removed in router due to testing go's response default?
