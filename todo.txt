General
* Improve readme file.
* Improve api documentation and check against go doc.

Router
* Decide on how named routes should be handled when another route is added with the same name, this also includes
refreshing of named route list. Should it panic, overwrite(update) route, return an error string? Should it still be added
to all routes/trie?
* Possible abstract trie to separate interfaces, RouteAdder - RouteSearcher - RouteAdderSearcher?
* Add has method for collection to check if route exists, will also need a compare method on route so that slices in
routes can be checked for equality. See https://play.golang.org/p/J48Jz51C73 and https://play.golang.org/p/mzvvoksjDq
* Decide what to do about nil route handlers.
