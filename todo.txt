Router
* Need to refactor trie to prevent second pass on leaf node. In add route:
    // If we get the leaf node again set the route and end.
    if node.segment == segment {
        node.route = route
        return
    }

    If this check is removed then the trie will add multiple of the same leaf node as children
    but with the route not set.
